The Movie Recommendation API is a FastAPI-based service that provides personalized movie recommendations based on content similarity. It utilizes a precomputed similarity matrix to find the most relevant movies based on a given title. Additionally, it fetches movie posters from The Movie Database (TMDB) API to enhance the user experience.
This API is designed for content-based filtering, where recommendations are generated by analyzing the similarity between movies using vectorized feature representations. It efficiently processes movie data stored in a pickled dataset and returns the top 9 similar movies along with their poster URLs.

Key components of this API include:
1- FastAPI for handling API requests efficiently.
2- Pickle-based data storage for quick access to the movie dataset and similarity scores.
3- TMDB API integration to fetch high-quality movie posters.
4- Google Colab compatibility for training and updating the recommendation model.

The API serves as a lightweight and scalable solution for movie recommendation applications, making it ideal for integration into web and mobile platforms.
